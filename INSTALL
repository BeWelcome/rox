=========================================
INSTALLATION
=========================================

First, if you're running Windows you won't need to configure
anything. Please refer to
http://bevolunteer.org/wiki/Getting_started_with_the_code#Windows

The rest of this text deals with installing on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and
other forms of Unix. Since there is no installation routine yet, you
will have to set up some things manually.  This doc will guide you
through the necessary steps.


==Apache and PHP configuration==
Requirements
* PHP version > 5.0
* Make sure php has short opening tags (needed currently for TB)
* Make sure php has GD lib enabled
* Make sure that Apache has mod_rewrite enabled

Copy all the files to your web server. Make sure the 'data' directory 
is world writable (chmod a+w data).

  1.  Database
  
    Please check out the test database from the develstuff repository
    https://www.bewelcome.org/svn/develstuff/trunk/testdb/hcvoltest.sql.gz.
    Unpack the file, manually create a MySQL database and fill it with
    hcvoltest.sql. (The directory "./maintenance" is not kept up-to-date.)
    

	Note: is that all?
	Note: You might want to do 
		UPDATE members SET password = PASSWORD('password');

  2.  Configuration file
  
    Open the file "./inc/config.inc.php.example", save it as
    "./inc/config.inc.php". Change the variables to your needs,
    at least the following variables:

  	* $db['dsn']
  	* $db['user']
  	* $db['password']
  	* $env['baseuri']

  3. Copy /bw/htdocs/bw/lib/config.php.dist -> /bw/htdocs/bw/lib/config.php (no need to edit the file in normal case)

  4.  .htaccess
  
    Copy htdocs/.htaccess.example  -> htdocs/.htaccess
    (OLD: You will need some rewriting directives for the system to work.
    Please set the "Rewrite-Base" directive.)
    
    Edit htdocs/.htaccess and modify RewriteBase (e.g./bw/htdocs/)

  5. Test that everything works


  
    Installation should be finished so far. Please check the
    service. If it fails, refer to:
	
	* "BeWelcome Developers Team" <bw-dev-discussion@bewelcome.org>
	* link to Trac
	* skype?
	* IRC?
