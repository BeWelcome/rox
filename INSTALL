=========================================
INSTALLATION
=========================================

Since there is no installation routine yet, you will have to set 
up some things manually.
This doc will guide you trough the necessary steps.

Requirements
* GD library
* PHP version > 5.0


Copy all the files to your web server. Make sure the 'data' directory is world writable.


  1.  Database
  
    Go into the directory "./maintenance". In there you will find
    directories for different RDBMS. In them you can find some
    .sql files. Apply them to your desired database.
    
    ** NOTE **
    You will have to start with the "user.sql" since most tables
    rely on that one.
    
  2.  Configuration file
  
    Open the file "./inc/config.inc.php.example", save it as
    "./inc/config.inc.php". Change the variables to your needs.
    
  3.  .htaccess
  
    You will need some rewriting directives for the system to work.
    Please set the "Rewrite-Base" directive.
    
  4.  Test
  
    Installation should be finished so far. Please check the
    service. If it fails, try to find solutions in the FAQ or
    in our tracker.
