=========================================
INSTALLATION
=========================================

Since there is no installation routine yet, you will have to set 
up some things manually.
This doc will guide you through the necessary steps.

Requirements
* GD library
* PHP version > 5.0
* Rewrite engine module for your web server (only tested with Apache)

Copy all the files to your web server. Make sure the 'data' directory 
is world writable (chmod a+w data).


  1.  Database
  
    Please check out the test database from the develstuff repository
    https://www.bewelcome.org/svn/develstuff/trunk/testdb/hcvoltest.sql.gz.
    Unpack the file, manually create a MySQL database and fill it with
    hcvoltest.sql. (The directory "./maintenance" is not kept up-to-date.)
    
  2.  Configuration file
  
    Open the file "./inc/config.inc.php.example", save it as
    "./inc/config.inc.php". Change the variables to your needs.
    
  3.  .htaccess
  
    You will need some rewriting directives for the system to work.
    Please set the "Rewrite-Base" directive.
    
  4.  Test
  
    Installation should be finished so far. Please check the
    service. If it fails, try to find solutions in the FAQ or
    in our tracker.
