INSTALLATION
============

First, for once, you will be lucky if you're running Windows.  You can
download a completely set up installation of WAMP that will allow you
to skip this entire process of configuring and tweaking.  Please refer
to http://bevolunteer.org/wiki/Getting_started_with_the_code#Windows

The rest of this text deals with installing on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and
other forms of Unix. Since there are no installation scripts yet, you
will have to set up some things manually.  This doc will guide you
through the necessary steps.  Don't despair if things don't work,
there are people around who are willing to help you if things don't
work right away.


==Apache and PHP configuration==
Requirements
* PHP version > 5.0
* Make sure PHP has short opening tags (needed currently for TB)
* Make sure PHP has GD lib enabled
* Make sure that Apache has mod_rewrite enabled

Copy all the files to your web server. Make sure the 'data' directory 
is world writable (chmod a+w data).

  1.  Database
  
    Download the test database from the develstuff repository
    https://www.bewelcome.org/svn/develstuff/trunk/testdb/hcvoltest.sql.gz.
    Unpack the file, manually create a MySQL database and fill it with
    hcvoltest.sql. (The directory "./maintenance" is not kept up-to-date.)
	
	$ svn checkout https://www.bewelcome.org/svn/develstuff/trunk/testdb/
	$ mysql -u root -p
	> CREATE DATABASE mtb;
	> quit
	$ zcat testdb/hcvoltest.sql.gz | mysql mtb -u root -p

	(On Mac OS X prior to 10.4, zcat can be used. Mac OS X 10.4 and newer should use 
	the gzcat command instead) 
	
    Note: In MySQL you might want to do 
	> UPDATE members SET password = PASSWORD('password');

  2.  Configuration file
  
    Open the file "./inc/config.inc.php.example", save it as
    "./inc/config.inc.php". Change the variables to your needs,
    at least the following variables:

  	* $db['dsn']
  	* $db['user']
  	* $db['password']
  	* $env['baseuri']

  3. Copy /bw/htdocs/bw/lib/config.php.dist -> /bw/htdocs/bw/lib/config.php (no need to edit the file in normal case)

  4. .htaccess
  
    Copy htdocs/.htaccess.example  -> htdocs/.htaccess
    (OLD: You will need some rewriting directives for the system to work.
    Please set the "Rewrite-Base" directive.)
    
    Edit htdocs/.htaccess and modify RewriteBase (e.g./bw/htdocs/)

  5. Test that everything works
