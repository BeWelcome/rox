INSTALLATION
============

First, for once, you will be lucky if you're running Windows.  You can
download a completely set up installation of WAMP that will allow you
to skip this entire process of configuring and tweaking.

The rest of this text deals with installing on GNU/Linux and other forms of
Unix.  Since there are no installation scripts yet, you will have to set up
some things manually.  This doc will guide you through the necessary steps. 
Don't despair if things don't work, there are people around who are willing
to help you if things don't work right away.


OVERVIEW
========

0. Requirements - Apache and PHP
1. Database installation
2. Import geographical data (optional)
3. Modify .ini files
4. Modify .htaccess file
5. Test the installation


==Apache and PHP configuration==

0. Requirements

  1. PHP version > 5.1
  2. Make sure PHP has GD lib enabled
 (3. Make sure PHP has short opening tags (needed currently for TB))
  4. Make sure that Apache has mod_rewrite enabled
  5. Make sure .htaccess works, i.e. no AllowOverride Node
  6. Be sure to PHP magic quotes gpc turned off
  7. An SMTP server must be available
 
In recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu (Fedora (8)):

  1 & 2:
      sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-gd
      (Fedora: yum install apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-gd)

  4:  sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/rewrite.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
      (cd /etc/httpd/conf)
      (cp httpd.conf httpd.conf.backup)
      (edit httpd.conf: uncomment the line 'LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so')
 
  5:  Comment out (put # in front of the rest) or remove all lines with
      "AllowOverride None" in: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
      (Comment out at least the ones that apply to /var/www)

  6:  Set magic_quotes_gpc to Off in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

Copy all the files to your web server (/var/www/html/ on Fedora).  Make sure
the 'data' directory exists (mkdir -p path_to_your_bwrox_installation/data)
and is world writable (chmod -R a+w path_to_your_bwrox_installation/data).

Make sure the following files exist and are writable by the web server. Change the
group "www-data" in the chgrp commands to whatever group your web server is in.

      cd path_to_your_bwrox_installation

      touch build/alias.cache.ini
      touch build/autoload.cache.ini
      touch modules/autoload.cache.ini
      touch pthacks/autoload.cache.ini
      touch tools/autoload.cache.ini
      touch htdocs/exception.log

      chgrp www-data build/autoload.cache.ini
      chgrp www-data modules/autoload.cache.ini
      chgrp www-data tools/autoload.cache.ini
      chgrp www-data pthacks/autoload.cache.ini
      chgrp www-data build/alias.cache.ini
      chgrp www-data htdocs/exception.log

      chmod g+rw build/autoload.cache.ini
      chmod g+rw modules/autoload.cache.ini
      chmod g+rw tools/autoload.cache.ini
      chmod g+rw pthacks/autoload.cache.ini
      chmod g+rw build/alias.cache.ini
      chmod g+rw htdocs/exception.log

      
After all this, make sure to restart Apache (/etc/init.d/apache2 restart)



  1.  Database
  
    The test database can be downloaded from
    http://downloads.bewelcome.org/for_developers/rox_test_db/bewelcome.sql.gz

      mysql -u root -p -e 'CREATE DATABASE bewelcome'
      unzip bewelcome.sql.gz
      cat bewelcome.sql | mysql bewelcome -u root -p
      gzip -dc bewelcome.sql.gz | mysql bewelcome -u root -p

    Then you might want to set the password to 'password' for all users:

      mysql bewelcome -u root -p -e 'UPDATE members SET password = PASSWORD("password")'

    ...or set "skip_password_check = true" in your rox_local.ini (see
    [development] section in rox_default.ini)
      
      Create a non-root user (e.g. with username bewelcome) for the database. 
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON bewelcome.* TO 'bewelcome'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
      
      Note: to update into the most recent DB version, browse to bw/groups.php on localhost. This will
      kick off the automatic DB update.
      

  2.  Geographical data

    There are sample geographical data included in the developer database dump.
    If you need more geographical data, please write to the bw-dev mailing
    list (see below) and request a dump of the geonames_* tables from the live
    database.

  3.  BW configuration files
  	
    Open the file "./rox_local.ini.example", save it as
    "./rox_local.ini".  Change the variables to your needs, at
    least the following variables:

      * $db['dsn']
      * $db['user']
      * $db['password']
      * $env['baseuri']

    rox_local.ini example: 
    -----------------------------------------------------------
		[db]
		dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=bewelcome"  
		user = "bewelcome"
		password = "password"
		
		[env]
		baseuri = "http://localhost/bewelcome/htdocs/"
	-----------------------------------------------------------		
		
    Since the move to a single config system, this is the only file
    you, possibly, will need to modify.

  4.  .htaccess
  
    Copy htdocs/.htaccess.example -> htdocs/.htaccess

    (OLD: You will need some rewriting directives for the system to
    work.  Please set the "Rewrite-Base" directive.)
    
    Edit htdocs/.htaccess and modify RewriteBase (e.g./bewelcome/htdocs/)
    
    htdocs/.htaccess example: 
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    	php_flag register_argc_argv off
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteBase /bewelcome/htdocs/
		
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteRule ^/*([^/]*)\.php /bw/$1.php [L,R,QSA]
		
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteRule ^.* index.php [L,QSA,PT]
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
  5.  Test, check that everything works


Installation should be finished so far.  If it's not working, refer to:

  * Wiki: http://trac.bewelcome.org/wiki
  * Mailing list: http://lists.bewelcome.org/mailman/listinfo/bw-dev-discussion
  * Chat: #bewelcome on irc.freenode.net


==Common issues==

* The requested URL /bewelcome/htdocs/main was not found on this server. 
	(at least on Max OS X and Fedora)

Things to check: 

- mod_htaccess is enabled in httpd.conf 

- allow_override all (or similar syntax) is set for the bw directory in httpd.conf
	Add these lines to httpd.conf (Fedora)
	-------------------------------------
	<Directory "/path_to_your_bwrox_installation/">
		AllowOverride All
	</Directory>
	-------------------------------------

- .htaccess is readable by apache and placed in the right directory 
	(should be /path_to_your_bwrox_installation/htdocs/)
