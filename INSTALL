INSTALLATION
============

First, for once, you will be lucky if you're running Windows.  You can
download a completely set up installation of WAMP that will allow you
to skip this entire process of configuring and tweaking.  Please refer
to:

  http://blogs.bevolunteer.org/blog/2007/11/07/hello-world/

The rest of this text deals with installing on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and
other forms of Unix.  Since there are no installation scripts yet, you
will have to set up some things manually.  This doc will guide you
through the necessary steps.  Don't despair if things don't work,
there are people around who are willing to help you if things don't
work right away.


==Apache and PHP configuration==

Requirements

  1. PHP version > 5.0
  2. Make sure PHP has GD lib enabled
 (3. Make sure PHP has short opening tags (needed currently for TB))
  4. Make sure that Apache has mod_rewrite enabled
  5. Make sure .htaccess works, i.e. no AllowOverride Node
  6. Be sure to PHP magic quotes gpc turned off
  7. An SMTP server must be available
 
In recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu (Fedora (8)):

  1 & 2:
      sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-gd
      (Fedora: yum install apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-gd)

  4:  sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/rewrite.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
      (cd /etc/httpd/conf)
      (cp httpd.conf httpd.conf.backup)
      (edit httpd.conf: uncomment the line 'LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so')
 
  5:  Comment out (put # in front of the rest) or remove all lines with
      "AllowOverride None" in: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
      (Comment out at least least the ones that apply to /var/www)

  6:  Set magic_quotes_gpc to Off in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

Copy all the files to your web server (/var/www/html/ on Fedora).  Make sure the 'data' directory
is world writable (chmod -R a+w path_to_your_bwrox_installation/data).  

After all this, make sure to restart Apache (/etc/init.d/apache2 restart)



  1.  Database
  
    Get the test database from the develstuff repository.  Unpack the
    file, manually create a MySQL database and import it:

      svn co https://bewelcome.org/svn/develstuff/trunk/testdb/  
      (newer version is currently at trunk/HCVolTest/hcvoltest.sql.gz)
      mysql -u root -p -e 'CREATE DATABASE bewelcome'
      zcat HCVolTest/hcvoltest.sql.gz | mysql bewelcome -u root -p

    (On Mac OS X 10.4 and later, use gzcat instead of zcat.)

    Then you might want to set the password to 'password' for all users:

      mysql bewelcome -u root -p -e 'UPDATE members SET password = PASSWORD("password")'
      
      Create a non-root user (e.g. with username bewelcome) for the database.  
      
      Note: to update into the most recent DB version, bw/groups.php on localhost.
      

  2.  Geographical data

    This step is (only?) necessary to be able to create new profiles
    and users with your local website. Import the following files from
    testdb in the repository:

      geonames_admincodes.sql.bz2
      geonames_cache.sql.bz2

   This is done the same way as above. (For a bz2 archive, bzcat can
   be used.)

  3.  BW configuration files
  	
    Open the file "./rox_local.ini.example", save it as
    "./rox_local.ini".  Change the variables to your needs, at
    least the following variables:

      * $db['dsn']
      * $db['user']
      * $db['password']
      * $env['baseuri']

    rox_local.ini example: 
    -----------------------------------------------------------
		[db]
		dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=bewelcome"  
		user = "bewelcome"
		password = "password"
		
		[env]
		baseuri = "http://localhost/bewelcome/htdocs/"
	-----------------------------------------------------------		
		
    Since the move to a single config system, this is the only file
    you, possibly, will need to modify.

  4.  .htaccess
  
    Copy htdocs/.htaccess.example -> htdocs/.htaccess

    (OLD: You will need some rewriting directives for the system to
    work.  Please set the "Rewrite-Base" directive.)
    
    Edit htdocs/.htaccess and modify RewriteBase (e.g./bw/htdocs/)
    
    htdocs/.htaccess example: 
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    	php_flag register_argc_argv off
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteBase /bw/htdocs/
		
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteRule ^/*([^/]*)\.php /bw/$1.php [L,R,QSA]
		
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteRule ^.* index.php [L,QSA,PT]
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
  5.  Configure the upload images directory.
    - Make data/images  accessible via the url 
      http://your.url.com/memberphotos/. You have(at least) two options:
	a) In Unix one can make a symbolic link from data/images to 
	   htdocs/memberphotos and ensure that the FollowsSymlinks is on. 
	b) Add the following lines(modify as required) to the apache conf file.
---- BEGIN APACHE EXTRACT ----
Alias /memberphotos/ "/path_to_your_bwrox_installation/upload/images/"

<Location /memberphotos>
</Location>

<Directory "/path_to_your_bwrox_installation/upload/images">
   AllowOverride None
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
</Directory>  
---- END APACHE EXTRACT ----

  6.  Test, check that everything works


Installation should be finished so far.  If it's not working, refer to:
	
  * web: http://dev.bevolunteer.org

  * mailing list: "BeWelcome developers discussion list" <bw-dev-discussion@bewelcome.org>

  * IRC: #bewelcome-dev on Freenode
  * email/jabber/gtalk: kasper.souren@gmail.com
  * skype: kasper.souren


==Common issues==

* The requested URL /bewelcome/htdocs/main was not found on this server. 
	(at least on Max OS X and Fedora)

Things to check: 

- mod_htaccess is enabled in httpd.conf 

- allow_override all (or similar syntax) is set for the bw directory in httpd.conf
	Add these lines to httpd.conf (Fedora)
	-------------------------------------
	<Directory "/path_to_your_bwrox_installation/">
		AllowOverride All
	</Directory>
	-------------------------------------

- .htaccess is readable by apache and placed in the right directory 
	(should be /path_to_your_bwrox_installation/htdocs/)
