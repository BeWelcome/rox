# Installation (with Vagrant)

### Requirements
* Vagrant
* Virtualbox

### Installation
* clone the repo
* run `vagrant up`
* get yourself a coffee or something, 'cause it will take a while
* once it's done, point your browser at http://192.168.33.10/ and you're ready to go

### Vagrant handful commands
* `vagrant up` for starting the VM. The first time, it will take a while before it gets ready, since it needs to provision it.
* `vagrant halt`: stop the VM but preserving the state
* `vagrant destroy`: stop the machine without preserving the state. Next time you'll run `vagrant up` it will reinstall the machine from scratch
* `vagrant ssh` for ssh into the VM. Project folder is located at `/vagrant`
* `vagrant provision` for running provision script again

### What doesn't work (yet)
* cron
* mail
* optional database dumps
