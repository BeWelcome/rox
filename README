The respice PlatformPT wiki is probably a good place to start learning
more about how and where things are done in the BW code:
http://platformpt.wiki.sourceforge.net/

The following places are also interesting and useful:

* PEAR coding standards

* Developer space on BeVolunteer: http://dev.bevolunteer.org
* BeWelcome/BeVolunteer developers' blog: http://blogs.bevolunteer.org/tech/
