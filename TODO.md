# TODO
* Add [PHP Debug Bar](https://github.com/maximebf/php-debugbar) with PDO query
log.
* Add a _CONTRIBUTING.md_ file.
* 'Remember me' functionality
* Get 'user rights' working again - integrate with Symfony permissions system?
* Restore the scriptfiles.html.twig / stylesheets.html.twig method of including
 additional assets.
* Seed language preference from user's saved option when they login.
* Set default language from Request::getPreferredLanguage() ?
* Keep setting IdMember value in session upon login so the old application still
 recognises logins.
* Logging out clears the session and therefore resets the language to back to
English
