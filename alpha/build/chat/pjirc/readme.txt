Plouf's Java IRC Client Applet
------------------------------

Webmaster's manual

Concepts
--------

  Thank you for using PJIRC! You'll find in this document all information you
  might need in order to understand what is PJIRC, how it works and how to
  install it. Please read it before asking questions on forums or even
  directly to the author.
  
  PJIRC is an IRC client, just like Opera is a HTTP client. PJIRC is just
  another front-end for the well-known IRC network. You're supposed to be
  familiar with the IRC concepts. If not, you should try to find more
  information about it before going further in this document and trying
  to install and use PJIRC.
  
  PJIRC has two distinct parts : the IRC engine and the GUI. The IRC engine
  handles all the boring and uninteresting stuff such as managing the
  connection, formatting messages and so on. You might think of it as being
  the "kernel". On the other hand, the GUI is responsible for displaying
  the result with a nice layout using plenty of CPU-consuming graphical
  stuff and so on.
  
  There are several PJIRC GUI's, and you can choose the one you prefer. You
  might think of them as "skins", but they are much more than that. The
  standard PJIRC package comes with a default GUI, the "Pixx GUI". You should
  find its specific documentation within this package. This document will
  only describe the IRC engine part.

Files
-----

  The following files are part of the IRC engine :
    IRCApplet.class   : Main Applet class file.
    irc.jar           : IRC Engine for non-IE VM, signed mode.
    irc.cab           : IRC Engine for IE VM, both mode.
    securedirc.cab    : IRC Signed specific part engine for IE VM, signed mode.
    irc-unsigned.jar  : IRC Engine for non-IE VM, unsigned mode.
    
    The cab files are only recognized by Internet Explorer. jar files
    are recognized by other Browsers or Java Virtual Machines. The class
    file is some kind of "executable file", think of it as being the
    "file that you execute" when you launch PJIRC.

    PJIRC can works in the modes : the "signed" mode and the "unsigned" mode.
    It is recommanded that you use the "signed" mode unless you have
    specific reasons to switch to unsigned mode. The mode PJIRC uses depends
    of the file you will tell it to use in the HTML Applet Fragment (see
    below).


Build
-----
	The unsigned IRC Engine can be built using the following javac compiler
	commands :
		javac -nowarn -g:none -O -target 1.1 IRCApplet.java
		javac -nowarn -g:none -O -target 1.1 irc\style\*.java
		javac -nowarn -g:none -O -target 1.1 irc\tree\*.java
		javac -nowarn -g:none -O -target 1.1 irc\dcc\prv\*.java
		javac -nowarn -g:none -O -target 1.1 irc\gui\prv\*.java
		javac -nowarn -g:none -O -target 1.1 irc\gui\common\*.java
		javac -nowarn -g:none -O -target 1.1 irc\ident\prv\*.java
		javac -nowarn -g:none -O -target 1.1 irc\gui\prv\*.java

Installation
------------
	Just upload the files you need, in regard to the mode (signed or unsigned)
	you want. Upload any extra files, such as language files or images and
	sound.

Applet html fragment
--------------------
	Using signed mode and the Pixx GUI, the following minimal applet fragment
	should work just fine :

	<applet code=IRCApplet.class archive="irc.jar,pixx.jar" width=640 height=400>
	<param name="CABINETS" value="irc.cab,securedirc.cab,pixx.cab">
	<param name="nick" value="Anonymous">
	<param name="name" value="PJIRC User">
	<param name="host" value="irc.diboo.net">
	<param name="gui" value="pixx">
	</applet>

Test your applet
----------------
	A test tool is available at http://www.pjirc.com/check.
	This tool will detect common errors and mistakes.

What is a server?
-----------------
  A server is any entity the client (PJIRC) connects to. There
  are three types of servers :
    - IRC server : usually referred as "the server",  this is
                   the server PJIRC was designed to connect to.

    - DCC server : a DCC (for Direct Client to Client) is a
                   special server for handling direct
                   connections to other clients.

    - Null server : the Null server is a ghost server,
                    physically connected to nothing.

What is a source?
-----------------
  The term "source" will be used throughout the remaining of this
  document. In short, a "source" stands for any "window" that can
  receive or send text or data to or from a server. A Channel is a
  Source, bound to an IRC server. A DCCChat is also a source, but
  bound to a DCC server. Here is the list of all known sources :

    - Default : not bound to anything (bound to the Null server),
                the Default source is used to handle any
                server-independent operations. This source
                cannot be left. It is only present if multiserver
                support is enabled.

    - Status : bound to an IRC server, the Status is used for
               any IRC server-specific operations or notifications.
               Leaving this source will lead to the server
               disconnection and eventually to all any sources
               related to this server. This source is unique and
               cannot be left is multiserver support is disabled.

    - Query : bound to an IRC server, the Query is a private
              chat between two clients, via the IRC server. This
              source can be left at any time.

    - Channel : bound to an IRC server, the Channel is a
                public room where many clients can chat, via
                the IRC server. This source can be left at
                any time, provided it is not restricted to do
                so by the application configuration. Leaving
                this source may sometimes take several seconds
                since a feedback from the server is required.

    - ChanList : bound to an IRC server, the ChanList enumerates
                 the listing of all available Channels on the
                 IRC server. This source can be left at any time.

    - DCCChat : bound to a DCC server, the DCCChat is a private
                chat between two clients, via the DCC server. This
                source can be left at any time. Leaving this
                source will lead to the DCC server disconnection.

    - DCCFile : bound to a DCC server, the DCCFile is a special
                source used for transmitting files from a client
                to another, via the DCC server. This source can
                be left at any time. Leaving this source will
                lead to the DCC server disconnection.

                     figure and image the image file name. Valid source types
                     are DCCChat, Channel, Query, Status, ChanList and Default.
                     As for the command parameter, there can't be any gap in the
                     X indexes.

  smileyX : set the Xnth smiley. A smiley is a pair of text->image. Each time
  -------   the text is found on a line, it will be replaced by the
            corresponding image. As for the command parameter, the first smiley
            must be smiley1 and there must'nt be any gap. The format of the
            parameter is "text image", where image is any URL the applet can
            access.

      <param name="style:floatingasl" value="true">

  floatingaslalpha : set the floating asl alpha transparency value. Between 0
  ----------------   and 255, 0 is invisible and 255 fully opaque. By default,
                     alpha value is 170. This parameter may be ignored if the
                     java virtual machine doens't support transparency.

gui. For instance, any Pixx GUI specific parameter will begin by 'pixx:'.

JavaScript support
------------------
  
  PJIRC is designed to support events from the "outside". The applet supports

  void sendString(String str) : send the given string to the server, through
                                the current source interpretor. For instance,
                                you can bring the channel list window by
                                calling sendString("/list")
                                
  void setFieldText(String txt) : set the textfield content.
  
  String getFieldText() : get the textfield content. setFieldText and
                          getFieldText can be combined to append text for the
                          user. For instance, adding a smiley can be done using
                          setFieldText(getFieldText()+':)')

Runtime commands
----------------

command will be sent as it (but without the initial / character) to the
server.
