The files in the css/ directory are either examples or page styles,
which were automatically loaded by the 'fragments/css.php' snippet.
You could create a "PageStyleFile.css" for every page of your wiki,
if you just include() the 'css.php' script.


core.css
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Is an example (text/css) stylesheet, which shows how to tweak
   the look of rendered pages using CSS.

   You could copy it into yoursites.css or do something like this in
   yoursite.php:

   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
     <STYLE TYPE="text/css"><!--
     <?php
            include("fragments/css/core.css");
     ?>
     //--></STYLE>
   </HEAD>
   <?php ... ?>


calendar.css
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   These stylesheet definitions show all possible CSS classes that
   are used within the calendar.php plugin. Use like core.css
