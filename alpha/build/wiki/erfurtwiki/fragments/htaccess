# This file is to be used with the Apache or Nanoweb webserver.
#
# Rename it to .htaccess (or .nwaccess for Nanoweb) in a dedicated
# directory for your Wiki.
#
# It uses the mod_rewrite to look a bit more professional than
# the usual GET-vars at the end of our URLs. This is highly
# recommended as things like "script.php?edit=1&id=page" usually 
# scare search engines and may prevent your Wiki from getting
# indexed fully.
#
# Please edit ewiki.php and enable EWIKI_USE_PATH_INFO for Apache
# webservers - the PATH_INFO implementation is very broken for many
# versions (at least when you use the PHP-CGI variant), because the
# Apache Group once choosed to follow that never finished and
# heavily broken (proposed) "CGI/1.1 RFC".

#-- enable mod_rewrite (Apache + Nanoweb)
RewriteEngine On

#-- pass WikiWord-URLs to the wiki wrapper script:
RewriteRule  ^((\w+/)?[A-Z]+[a-z]+\w*[A-Z]+\w+)$  yoursite.php/$1  [L]

#-- or this one, if there is really nothing else in the same directory:
#RewriteRule  ^(.*)$  yoursite.php?id=$1  [L]
