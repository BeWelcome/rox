To make clickable images, we'll need to patch the ewiki_link_regex_callback()
function. It must recall itself to get images rendered as links.

- edit ewiki.php
- search for "function ewiki_link_regex_callb"
- after the whole code block "#-- anchors"\n... insert:

   #-- image links
   if (strpos($title, "://") && ($title != $href)) {
      $tmp_img = ewiki_link_regex_callback(array("[$title]"));
      if (strpos($tmp_img, "<img") === 0) {
         $title = $tmp_img;
         $force_noimg = 1;
      }
   }

- save and test your changed ewiki.php

To get a clickable image, then just write in your WikiPages something like:
[http://www.google.com/ "http://images.org/pic1.png"]

WARNING: You open your Wiki up for advertisements and spamming if you allow
this. I'd personally vote against this function, because Wiki was meant as
a hyperTEXT system based upon the HTML (HyperTextMarkupLanguage) - but this
tweak will get you near HPML (HyperPictureMarkupLanguage).

And on another side note: it's probably simpler just to enable _HTML.
