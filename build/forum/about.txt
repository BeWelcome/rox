This is an attempt by lemon-head to refactor/rewrite the forums application.
I would like to work more on it, but there are other sites of construction.
Main goal is to have more and smaller classes,
with less coupling and better adhesion.

Another new thing is using the ItemlistWithPagination for the pagination links.

The older version can be found in build/forums.
The main problem here is too big classes, especially the model.

If you decide that this recoding is a bad idea,
and you would rather work on the older version,
this can be discussed.
