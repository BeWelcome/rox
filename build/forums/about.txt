
This is the forums application,
which is currently in an unstable state.

It is very different from the forums on alpha and production,
because it uses a DB structure which supports multi-language,
and stores tags in a different (and better) way.

One problem with this app is too big and monolithic classes
with too much coupling. 

A rewrite has been started in build/forum, by lemon-head,
who now is busy with different other things.

If you decide that this recoding is a bad idea,
and you would rather work on the older version,
this can be discussed.

Forum is big but still manageable
Ask JeanYves in case of problem
