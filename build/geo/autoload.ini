; This file tells the central __autoload() function, where the classes are defined.

; On the left side you write the filename,
; on the right you write a list of all classes which are defined in that file.
; (most often only one class per file)
; (classnames separated by spaces, comma, what you like)

; Controller
; The name of this class is important for the routing.
; "http://.../hellouniverse" should go to the HellouniverseController::index() method.
geo.ctrl.php       = GeoController

; Model (so far, it's an empty class)
geo.model.php      = GeoModel

; Pages
places.page.php      = PlacesPage
