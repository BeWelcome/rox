; On the left side you write the filename,
; on the right you write a list of all classes which are defined in that file.
; (most often only one class per file)
; (classnames separated by spaces, comma, what you like)

; Controller
; The name of this class is important for the routing.
; "http://.../hellouniverse" should go to the HellouniverseController::index() method.
