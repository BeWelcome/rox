This directory is used to collect source code patches to get some
non-standard features to work. You'll find more detailed info on
what the patch does, and how to integrate it, in the according
code snippet files.

Some of these patches may get integrated into the core and others
may be converted into plugins in future releases, however most stuff
in here is to uncommon and disliked to do so currently.

Please also note, that the patches/ subdirectory should be used by
experienced users only, as it often requires you to have read the
README file and it also requires more skills than using the "unzip" 
utility.
There is no support at all for these patches.
