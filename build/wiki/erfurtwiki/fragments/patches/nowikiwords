If you desire to disable WikiWord linking in ewiki (which we of course
strongly discourage), leaving your users with the square brackets linking
feature; you will need to edit the regular expressions (called "regexs" in
programmer lingo) that are responsible for rendering.

In ewiki.php search for the "variable configuration settings" defaults,
which later would be copyied into $ewiki_config. There you have to tweak
the "wiki_link_regex" block and (optionally) the "wiki_pre_scan_regex".
There just strip any line that contains 'EWIKI_CHARS'. This should be it.
