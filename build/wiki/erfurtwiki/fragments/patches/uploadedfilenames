This patch will add the orignial (client side) filename to the internal://
string generated by the binary upload functions. Usually these database
names only carry the md5 sum of the uploaded files content (which is good,
because no file can be uploaded twice).
You will get more readable filenames with db_flat_files, but this also
introduces a security risk because the client (and the users) define the
database filename.


- edit ewiki.php
- find the "function ewiki_binary_save_image("
- go the the code block "#-- generate db file name"
- after the line "$md5sum = md5($content);"
  insert following line:

      $md5sum = $add_meta["Content-Location"] . "." . $md5sum;

- (alternatively you could replace the first "$md5sum = ..." line)
