It's probably good idea to have some basic documentation in the svn
repository.  The two main reasons are:
 * The repository will public sooner than the BW volunteer wiki (if
   ever, and it's hard to keep track of public pages on the wiki).
 * Most developers are much more common with updating things in svn.

A minor reason is:
 * It's nice to be able to do know what you can do, and to read and
   write documentation when you're not connected to the web.


== treemap.txt ==

To get an overview of what's where in this repository and what it's
for.


== easytasks.txt ==

Some easy tasks to improve the code (that don't require any advanced
insight in the code, but that will give you insight in it anyway).


== glossary.txt ==

What is BW Rox, TB, respice, YAML?


== some more ideas ==

Waiting for feedback on these:

 * ess-reading.txt, some somewhat essential stuff to read to get
   insight in the code and to know what we want the code to look like?
   E.g. PEAR coding standards? What else?

 * tb-transition.txt, things that need to be done to move away from
   the old BW code.
