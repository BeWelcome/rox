===== Bulk User Import =====

Requires a CSV file of users with at least four columns.
The columns must contain, in order: user-id, full name, email address and groups.
The CSV fields should be separated by commas (,) and strings delimited by quotation marks (%%""%%). Backslash (\) can be used for escaping.
For an example of a suitable file, try the "Export Users" function above.
Duplicate user-ids will be ignored.

A password will be generated and emailed to each successfully imported user.
