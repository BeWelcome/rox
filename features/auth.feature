Feature: Login/logout
  In order to use the API
  As a user
  I must be able to login and logout

  Scenario: As unknown user, I cannot log in
    Given I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    When I send a "POST" request to "/api/login" with body:
    """
    {
      "username": "invalid",
      "password": "invalid"
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 401
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
    {
      "code": 401,
      "message": "Invalid credentials."
    }
    """

  Scenario Outline: As a valid user, I can log in with my username
    Given I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"

    """
    {
      "username": "<username>",
      "password": "password"
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 204
    And a refresh-token has been created on user "<username>"
    When I send a "GET" request to "/api/members"
    Then the response status code should be 200
