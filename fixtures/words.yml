    FAQ4_A:
        code: faqa_howdoifindaccomodation
        ShortCode: en
        Sentence: 'Go to the “Find members” page and enter the name of the location you are going to visit in the text box (a city, town, or village – the search does not work with countries or regions). When you start typing the location name, a list will show the possible locations. If the place has BeWelcome members that will be indicated with a number in parenthesis. Choose the correct location, click on “search”, and you will get a list of all active profiles registered at that location (and, by default, in a radius of 25km/15mi around that location). Take your time to review the profiles and read the information given there carefully. Then write a message to those members you would like to stay with. There are also advanced options available to refine your search. For example, you can limit your search to the exact location you entered or extend it to a wider area by choosing a wider radius. You can also limit your search to members who can host more than one person by choosing the respective option. Additionally, there are several options to sort your results. Other possibilities to find host include the “Browse countries” page and the “Map search” (detailed instructions available on that page).'
