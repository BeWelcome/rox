This folder is deprecated and you should use not use it.  Most of this
stuff is already in roxlauncher.

The stuff in inc/ contains mostly global scope code, and global scope
variables. Not really what we want.  In RoxLauncher we have the same
stuff (or something better) packed into object methods. Much better.
(that's what limon-kopf thinks)

Why are object methods nicer: because you can make another object with
a different implementation, that replaces the old one.
