== Database Updates ==
This folder contains SQL files which will apply required updates to your MySQL
database, whenever the database structure has been changed or extended.

To see if you need an update, the file names have been given a fixed structure
that should enable you to see if you need an update or not.

=== File name descriptin ===
File names are divided into two parts. First part is the revision that the 
database will be compatible with after applying updates. The second part of 
the name, is the table that needs and update or has been added. 
See an example below:

         1123_blog.sql
         |    |
         |    |
         |    The table blog
         |    will need an update.
         |
         revision older than 1123 will need this update.
         After applying this update DB compatible with revision 1122
         will be compatible with revision 1123.
         Revision 1123 and any revision after 1123, e.g. 1124 or 1137,
         already include this update in the default database
         file.
