<h3>Privacy Police</h3>

<p>BeWelcome offers an online place to meet friends, and a chance to meet people in the real world. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of BeWelcome's policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any Personal Information you submit to us through our Website.
BeWelcome ("BeWelcome", "us" or "we") respects the privacy of the visitors to its Website, the home page of which is located at http://www.BeWelcome.org ("Website"). </p>

<h4>Terms of this disclaimer</h4>
<p>"Personal Information" is information about you that is personally identifiable to you, like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.
"Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h4>User Consent</h4>
<p>By submitting Personal Information through our Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Information may be processed by BeWelcome in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States of America) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>

<h4>General</h4>
<p>We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through our Website. • When you register for the BeWelcome network, we will collect your name, e-mail address, your gender, date of birth and ZIP code. • When you save other Personal Information in your profile we will collect any such information you enter. • When you enter Personal Information throughout the BeWelcome network using one of the features of the BeWelcome network, for example blogs, groups, or message boards (forum), we will collect any such information you enter ("Publicly Posted Information"). • When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect your e-mail addresses and any information contained in the e-mail you send us. Once you register with BeWelcome and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. If you are browsing the Website without registering with BeWelcome, you are anonymous to us, but we will collect the information listed below under Personal Information Collected Via Technology.</p>

<h4>Use of information</h4>
<p>Any visitor of the BeWelcome website can view your profile information and photos that you have uploaded to the BeWelcome community. You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the BeWelcome website and which network of BeWelcome members can see what information. To provide you with some of the features that the BeWelcome community offers to its members, we may use Personal Information that is stored in your profile after you have requested such features, for example to send invitation e-mails to people that you specified as being interested in joining the BeWelcome community. When you decide to view a member's profile, we may show that BeWelcome member that you chose to view their profile. If you decide to use certain features of the BeWelcome network (like blogs, groups, message boards and the like), some of the Personal Information you entered into your BeWelcome profile and any information, including Personal Information, that you enter using one of these features, might be used and displayed. BeWelcome members can use the search feature to search for other members by different criteria, like location or interests. The Personal Information that BeWelcome members enter into the BeWelcome profile will be used for these searches. Please be aware that any information that is publicly posted throughout the BeWelcome network can be accessed by every visitor of the Website. BeWelcome may analyze any collected information for its own internal purposes. BeWelcome may use Anonymous Information for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Information in its discretion.</p>

<h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
<p>BeWelcome does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or as otherwise described in this privacy policy.
We will disclose information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may disclose information, if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving the physical safety of any person, violations of BeWelcome's terms of use, or as otherwise required by applicable law. </p>

<h4>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</h4>
<p>As you navigate the Website, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to make our services and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the BeWelcome community experience to meet your special interests and needs. If you search the BeWelcome community by using a toolbar that BeWelcome, we may collect Anonymous Information about you automatically, but we will not collect Personal Information.
An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. BeWelcome may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly. Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within the BeWelcome network. Other companies' and organisations' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. </p>

<h4>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the BeWelcome service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the BeWelcome Newsletter, that are considered part of your BeWelcome account. If you would like to opt out of certain messages, log into BeWelcome and go to your account settings by clicking the account link in the top right hand corner. On that page you can edit your preferences. If you would like to delete your account, log into BeWelcome, go to your account settings page by clicking the account link in the top right hand corner. On that page, right below the email address field you will see a link to cancel your account.</p>

<h4>Confidentiality and Security</h4>
<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees and third parties who we reasonably believe need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you and your BeWelcome account information is protected by a password that you select. BeWelcome uses industry-standard SSL encryption in certain areas of the Website to protect data transmissions. However, no company, including BeWelcome, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. </p>

<p>Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents.

We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat Personal Information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your BeWelcome account or by placing a prominent notice on our Website.
