This directory contains all information to create an anonymized dump from the live DB.

First thing to do is to dump the live DB, drop your old test DB and import the dump from live.

Now run the anonymizer SQL script

 mysql -u root -p < anonymizer.sql

If you feel like 'First Last' or 'First Second Last' and 'Random Street' isn't your thing, run the randomize script to create random name association

php rqandomize.php

It will pick up the credentials for DB access from the rox_local.ini file (and take a while to finish).
