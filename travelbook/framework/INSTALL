=========================================
INSTALLATION
=========================================

Since there is no installation routine yet, you will have to set 
up some things manually.
This doc will guide you trough the necessary steps.


  1.  Database
  
    Go into the directory "./maintenance". In there you will find
    directories for different RDBMS. In them you can find some
    .sql files. Apply them to your desired database.
    
    ** NOTE **
    You will have to start with the "user.sql" since most tables
    rely on that one.
    
  2.  Configuration file
  
    Open the file "./inc/config.inc.php.example", save it as
    "./inc/config.inc.php". Change the variables to your needs.
    
  3.  .htaccess
  
    You will need some rewriting directives for the system to work.
    Please set the "Rewrite-Base" directive.
    
  4.  Test
  
    Installation should be finished so far. Please check the
    service. If it fails, try to find solutions in the FAQ or
    in our tracker.
