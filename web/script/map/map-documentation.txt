##### Here is a short description of the files used by the Map functionality #####


**** htdocs/script/main.js ****
This file is used to add/remove JS and CSS files (nothing specific to search function here)

**** build/searchmembers/templates/ajax.php ****
Here is the formatted answer of search ajax requests (search member lists, map popup content, etc...)

**** htdocs/script/searchmembers.js: this is the original JS file and the entry point for map search functionalities.
I tried to refactor it, first by removing GMap references.
It is still a bit complicated, but really easier to understand now


##### I added the following files (I come from Java world, il like to have 1 class per file, and single responsability classes, if you disagree we can talk about that too) #####

**** htdocs/script/map/builder/OSMMapBuilder.js ****
Low level map manipulation (initMap, addLayer, addControl...)

**** htdocs/script/map/builder/BWGeosearchMapBuilder.js ****
High level map manipulation matching map search needs (addHostMarker, zoomIn...)

**** htdocs/script/map/builder/BWSimpleMapBuilder.js ****
High level map manipulation matching blog, signin and travel pages needs (addSimpleMarker, addFlagMarker...)

**** htdocs/script/map/geolocation/BWGoogleMapReverseGeolocator.js ****
Current used implementation of geolocation (so yes we are still not totally free) 
=> we have to work on that later, cause my experimentation with Geoname and Nominatim, including in search autocomplete are not working like expected

**** htdocs/script/map/geolocation/BWGeonameMapReverseGeolocator.js ****
Experimentation using geoname, not used

**** htdocs/script/map/geolocation/BWNominatimMapReverseGeolocator.js ****
Experimentation using nominatim with openstreetmap, not used

**** htdocs/script/map/leaflet/*.js ****
Custom Leaflet classes used to extend the classical behaviour (only LeafletLabelIcon.js is used in the current version in order to display the classical markers)

**** htdocs/script/map/search/BWMapSearchAutocomplete.js ****
Experimentation with autocomplete, not used

**** htdocs/script/map/small/*.js ****
Display maps in blog, signin and travel pages 

**** htdocs/script/map/*.js ****
Container (beans) classes used to manipulate cleaner objects
